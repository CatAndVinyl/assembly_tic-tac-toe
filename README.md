# N-Square Tic-Tac-Toe (MIPS32 Assembly) - 2021

## Description

This project is an implementation of a tic-tac-toe game in MIPS32 Assembly. What makes it unique is that it allows the player to determine the size of the game board, creating an "N-Square Tic-Tac-Toe" game. This game is a classic two-player board game where the objective is to get a sequence of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal on a square grid. The size of the grid is adjustable, making it more challenging and versatile.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need a MIPS32 Assembly environment, such as the MIPS simulator SPIM. You can download and install SPIM from the official website: [SPIM Simulator](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/)

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CatAndVinyl/N-Square-Tic-Tac-Toe.git
```
## Running the Code

1. Open SPIM (the MIPS simulator).
2. Load the provided assembly file, typically with a `.asm` extension, into the simulator.
3. Run the simulation. Depending on your specific simulator, there may be different ways to do this.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game following the instructions mentioned in the "Running the Code" section.
2. You will be prompted to enter the size of the game board. Choose an integer value for N (e.g., 3 for traditional tic-tac-toe or any other size you prefer).
3. The game will start with an empty N x N board.
4. Players take turns to place their symbols (e.g., "X" and "O") on the board.
5. When prompted, X's and O's are placed by entering a coordinate pair (row and column) indexed from 0. Ex: 0 4
6. The objective is to get N of your symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
7. The game will announce the winner or declare a draw when the board is full and no one has won.
